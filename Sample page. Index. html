<h1>A little introduction about myself</h1>

<p>My name is edward Edward Emmanuel, i'm a technology passionate,hobbist and a researcher
started coding two years ago from an awesome communinity <i>sololearn<i/>

 https://www.sololearn. being able to work and learn for me then was a bit a challange
for me but coming across this platform with alot of motivation stories of developer's
from difference part of the world was a huge help for me, <i>sololearn</i>
for me it was the backbone behind my success stories,
though i study from other platform like <b>Youtube, Udemy,Enki and so many other platform
but i will not complete the list without mentioning <strong>W3School</strong> yes another great platform to learn code for free but
